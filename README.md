# Machine-learning-algorithms-on-Wine-Dataset
This repository is designed for beginners in machine learning. It applies various machine learning algorithms such as perceptron, linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, k means clustering etc on the standard wine quality dataset.


The dataset is imported from the following link- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
It contains 12 attribute columns and has about 5000 instances. The dataset is useful both for classification as well as regression analysis.


Further description about each algorithm is given in the jupyter notebook. A separate jupyter notebook has been developed for every algorithm. Later these notebooks can be used for comparitive analysis.
